ntpd

The ntp daemon ntpd calculates the drift of your system clock and continuously adjusts it, so there are no large corrections that could lead to inconsistent logs for instance. The cost is a little processing power and memory, but for a modern server this is negligible.
Installation

To install ntpd, from a terminal prompt enter:

sudo apt-get install ntp

Configuration

Edit /etc/ntp.conf to add/remove server lines. By default these servers are configured:

# Use servers from the NTP Pool Project. Approved by Ubuntu Technical Board
# on 2011-02-08 (LP: #104525). See http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html for
# more information.
server 0.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org
server 1.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org
server 2.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org
server 3.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org

After changing the config file you have to reload the ntpd:

sudo /etc/init.d/ntp reload
