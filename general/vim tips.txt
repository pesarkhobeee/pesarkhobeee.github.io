Basic search and replaceEdit

The :substitute command searches for a text pattern, and replaces it with a text string. There are many options, but these are what you probably want:

:%s/foo/bar/g
    Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'. 

:s/foo/bar/g
    Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'. 

:%s/foo/bar/gc
    Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first. 

:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc
    Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. 

:%s/foo/bar/gci
    Change each 'foo' (case insensitive) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. 
    This may be wanted after using :set noignorecase to make searches case sensitive (the default). 

:%s/foo/bar/gcI
    Change each 'foo' (case sensitive) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. 
    This may be wanted after using :set ignorecase to make searches case insensitive. 

The g flag means global â€“ each occurrence in the line is changed, rather than just the first. This tip assumes the default setting for the 'gdefault' and 'edcompatible' option (off), which requires that the g flag be included in %s///g to perform a global substitute. Using :set gdefault creates confusion because then %s/// is global, whereas %s///g is not (that is, g reverses its meaning).

When using the c flag, you need to confirm for each match what to do.
